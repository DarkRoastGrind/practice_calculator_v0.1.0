--------------- 29 MAY 25: ---------------
------ MAJOR: ------
- Created logic for every single possible input/output combination with regard to the operations buttons. 
	Examples: If the input is filled/empty, check if holders are filled/empty, and if the output is filled/empty.

- Released an exe version of the application. 

------ MINOR: ------
- Removed CalculationsBothFilled function, as it no longer served a purpose. 
- Created CalcualteTriple function, then simplified and removed it, as it was reduntant. 


------ BUG FIXES: ------
Logic operation fixes by the redesign of logic functions:
- Any symbol input after a first symbol input causes an error.
- Hitting = after a number has been calculated only concatenates the number onto itself. 
- Hitting = causes an error
- Pressing any symbol after a calculation causes an error. 
- Attempting to do an operation following a previous, uncleared operation does not work.
	The second number remains the same, and the output is changed based only on the second number.

Design fixes:
- Negative numbers show their symbol on the right, rather than the left. 
	Changed the output box from right-to-left,to text-align instead. 


--------------- 26 MAY 25: ---------------
------ MAJOR: ------ 
- Added a new form, "Calculator"

- Added functionality to the number buttons.
	Clicking on the number buttons now concatenates numbers to the input box. 
	Attempting to use the decimal button more than once simply returns,
	stopping multiple decimal inputs. 

- Added clear input button.
	Clears the input box only, not the entire calculation.

- Added new Operation Label
	Allows for separation of function usage in order to stop complicated code. 
	Now only one function is required to modify the operation symbol
	Prevent clutter 


------ MINOR: ------
- Added readme
- Added changelog
- Added devlog file.
- Added bug_tracker file.


------ BUG FIXES: ------
