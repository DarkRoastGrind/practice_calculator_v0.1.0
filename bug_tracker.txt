Known bugs:
- Any symbol input after a first symbol input causes an error.
- Hitting = after a number has been calculated only concatenates the number onto itself. 
- Pressing any symbol after a calculation causes an error. 
- Negative numbers show their symbol on the right, rather than the left. 
- Attempting to do an operation following a previous, uncleared operation does not work.
	The second number remains the same, and the output is changed based only on the second number.
