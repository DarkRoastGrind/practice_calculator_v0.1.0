------ TODO: ------
-	Rename label functions for output for better readability. 

-	Add check in the calculation functions to look for 
	0's at the beginning of input strings. If there are any, remove,
	Unless there is a decimal present, then remove all 0's up to the decimal. 
	
-	Clean the logic for the operations buttons. 
	More helper functions can be created to simplify the logic and clutter.
	Not to mention, a lot of the logic can be simplified.


------ Completed: ------
